## **Fake News Detection using Machine Learning**  

### üìå **Project Overview**  
The **Fake News Detection System** is a machine learning-based solution to classify news articles as **real or fake**. The project aims to address the growing issue of misinformation by using various machine learning algorithms for classification.  

---

### üîç **Problem Statement**  
Fake news has become a serious issue, influencing public opinion and democracy. The rapid spread of misinformation, especially on social media, necessitates a reliable system to detect and prevent fake news. The project focuses on developing **automated machine learning models** to accurately classify news articles as **real** or **fake**.

---

### üóÉ **Dataset**  
- The dataset consists of **news articles labeled as real or fake**.
- Features include:
  - **Title**: News headline  
  - **Text**: Full article content  
  - **Label**: Binary classification (1 = Fake, 0 = Real)  
- The dataset is split into **training (70%)** and **testing (30%)** sets.

### ‚öô **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: `NLTK`, `spaCy`
  - **Machine Learning**: `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`
  - **Data Processing**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`
  - **Model Evaluation**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

---

### üöÄ **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Remove stopwords and punctuation  
   - Tokenization & Lemmatization  
   - Convert text to numerical format using TF-IDF  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed the distribution of real vs. fake news  
   - Visualized word frequency using graphs  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Trained **Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN** models  
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

4. **Prediction & Testing**:
   - Deployed models to classify new/unseen news articles
